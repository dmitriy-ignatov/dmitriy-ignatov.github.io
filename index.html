            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My mission is to strive as an individual that is a leader, a friend, and someone that never stops learning and developing their craft in all facets of life including personal and professional. The goal is to build a career intersecting my abilities in both sales and software, where I can use both the technical skills of computer science and data analysis that solve real world problems, while bridging my sales experience to connect businesses and people with technology to create meaningful change. The role of a Business Development Manager, Solutions Engineer, or Pre Sales Consultant are areas that both intrigue me and suit my skill set that I continue to build. In these roles, I look to lead through authenticity, inspire through both my work and mentorship, and create long term value for clients, colleagues and me. When all things are said and done, I want to be remembered as an individual that bridged the gap between technological innovation and human connection, empowering future generations in all the areas I have touched in business, technology, and the community around me. </p>
