            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My mission is to strive as an individual that is a leader, a friend, and someone that never stops learning and developing their craft in all facets of life including personal and professional.
                The goal is to build a career intersecting my abilities in both sales and software, 
                where I can use both the technical skills of computer science and data analysis that solve real world problems, while bridging my sales experience to connect businesses and people with technology to create meaningful change.
                The role of a Business Development Manager, Solutions Engineer, or Pre Sales Consultant are areas that both intrigue me and suit my skill set that I continue to build.
                In these roles, I look to lead through authenticity, inspire through both my work and mentorship, and create long term value for clients, colleagues and me.
                When all things are said and done, I want to be remembered as an individual that bridged the gap between technological innovation and human connection,
                empowering future generations in all the areas I have touched in business, technology, and the community around me.

            <h2>Problem Statement (Project Management 2)</h2>
            <p><strong>One‑sentence summary:</strong> USC students seeking entry‑level tech‑sales/SE roles lack a clear path to beginner‑friendly, skills‑matched opportunities across fragmented sources.</p>
            <p><strong>Full statement:</strong> Primary users: USC undergraduates pursuing entry‑level tech‑sales and solutions‑engineering roles who have basic CS coursework and some customer‑facing experience.
            Problem: These students cannot easily find beginner‑friendly roles that combine technical fundamentals with customer interaction, because openings are scattered across portals and lack clear skill prerequisites.
            Goal: Provide a curated, skills‑mapped feed of internships, on‑campus projects, and micro‑experiences with checklists, examples, and application tips tailored to tech‑sales/SE pathways.
            Scope &amp; constraints: Focus on USC and remote roles; require verifiable postings; update weekly; deliver via a simple web page.
            Success metrics: ≥30 qualified opportunities/month; ≥20% click‑through from students who view the feed; ≥10 student applications/month attributed to the site within 60 days.</p>
